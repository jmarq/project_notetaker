#Project Notetaker
##(a notetaker for projects)

### Functionality
- command line utility
- use conf file to choose project containing folders
- utility lists projects in those folders
- user can choose a project and quickly add to its TODO.txt
- optional flag to jump into TODO with vim.

### Tools must already exist for this, DaVinci
- learning experience, solving my own problem for the sake of repetition in the world of solving problems
- the code will probably be very a simple python and bash implementation, a humble notetaking project striving to ease a less-than-optimally-organized man's mind.
