the TODO.txt of a TODO.txt appender.  
seems almost like sacred ground.
will this be in the git repo?

TODO:

how to dictate where to get/put TODO files?
a conf file probably

what about....
a list of directories that contain project folders 
a pairing of project names and TODO paths
if no entry for project, but project directory is in conf file
  name will be folder name, path will be folder itself
if path is a file, use that file as the TODO
if path is a directory, place TODO in that directory

project names are used for recognition over recall in cli
